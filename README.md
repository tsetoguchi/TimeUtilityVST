- JUCE (v7 or later)

- A C++ compiler (e.g. Xcode, MSVC, or g++)

- A plugin host (e.g. Ableton Live, Logic Pro, REAPER) to load the compiled VST3/AU plugin


## Building

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/tsetoguchi/TimeUtilityVST.git
cd TimeUtilityVST
```

2. Open the project with your preferred JUCE-compatible IDE via the CMakeLists.txt file.

3. Build the plugin for your target format (VST3, AU, etc.).

4. Copy the built plugin to your systemâ€™s plugin folder.
